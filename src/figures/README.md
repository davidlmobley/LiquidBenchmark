# Scripts for figures


## Manifest (partial)
Many of these are from Kyle Beauchamp's original repo and are unmodified here. I have modified:
- plot_tbv.py: Plots new SMIRNOFF values using same approach as Beauchamp originally used
- plot_tbv_both.py: Plots Beauchamp's original GAFF values as well as new SMIRNOFF values, using same approach Beauchamp originally used but produces graphs styled differently.
